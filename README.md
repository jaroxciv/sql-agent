### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaroxciv/sql-agent.git
cd sql-agent

# Initialize uv project and virtual environment
uv init
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Unix/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Sync dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Run the Dockerized Database


```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Configure `.env`

```bash
DB_TYPE=postgresql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=chinook
DB_PASSWORD=chinook
DB_NAME=chinook
LLM_API_KEY=sk-...          # Your OpenAI or Mistral API key
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o            # Or your preferred model
MEMORY_SCHEMA=public
MAX_ROWS=30
```

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501/) in your browser.

### ‚ö° Architecture

```text
docker/
  ‚îú‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml       # Spins up Postgres + PgAdmin
  ‚îú‚îÄ init.sql                  # Chinook database schema/data
llm_clients/                   # Swappable LLM client classes (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.)
agents.py                      # Modular SQL Agent logic
app.py                         # Streamlit UI
data_models.py                 # Pydantic schema models for safe/clear DB introspection
db_knowledge.py                # Chinook table relationships & example queries
default_prompts.json           # Prompt templates with schema, notes, examples
llm_memory.py                  # Postgres-backed session memory
prompts.py                     # Prompt manager to inject into Langgraph nodes
requirements.txt
utils.py                       # Data dictionary extraction, prompt loading, etc.
```

### üß† Extending or Adapting

- Change to your own database:

Update init.sql, .env, and re-extract the schema (see extract_data_dictionary).

- Switch LLM:

Add a client in llm_clients/ and set in .env.

- Add prompt templates or demo examples:

Update default_prompts.json and db_notes.py.

- Production deploy:

Add HTTPS, secrets management, and cloud hosting as needed.
